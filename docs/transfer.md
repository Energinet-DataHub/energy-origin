# Transfer Domain Overview

The `transfer` domain is responsible for handling transfer agreements and related automation within the project. It is organized into several subcomponents:

## Structure

- **ClaimAutomation/**: Handles automation related to claims in the transfer process.
- **Shared/**: Contains shared code and utilities used across the transfer domain.
- **Testing/**: Includes test resources and utilities for the transfer domain.
- **Transfer.API/**: The main API surface for transfer-related operations.
- **TransferAgreementAutomation/**: Contains the automation logic for transfer agreements, including:
  - **Worker/**: Background processing service for transfer agreement automation.
  - **Worker.IntegrationTests/**: Integration tests for the worker service.
  - **Worker.UnitTests/**: Unit tests for the worker service.
  - **configuration.yaml**: Configuration file for the automation worker.
- **docker-environment/**: Docker-related files for local development and testing.

## Key Responsibilities
- Managing transfer agreements between organizations.
- Automating status updates and processing of transfer requests.
- Providing API endpoints for transfer operations.
- Supporting automated and manual testing of transfer logic.

## Notable Files
- `TransferAgreementAutomation/Worker/Service/Engine/TransferEngineUtility.cs`: Contains utility logic for updating transfer statuses and interacting with external systems.
