# Auth Domain

## Container diagram

![Container diagram](../diagrams/auth.container.drawio.svg)

## Old endpoints

There is a description of the current endpoints available at [Auth API](../../api/auth.md).

## Tokens

It is important to understand there is one token meant for outside the cluster and one meant for inside the cluster.
Both these tokens are made by the Auth domain. The inner tokens relays user details and related information to each domain,
so they never has to ask for additional information. The outer tokens relays user settings to the frontend.

**Outer token**: Frontend-oriented roles/features/capabilities
```jsonc
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "features": "certificates fun jokes",
  "roles": "admin",
  "capabilities": "view"
  //...
}
```

**Inner token**: Backend-oriented where more sensitive data is permissiable
```jsonc
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "meters": "571369256606002442 57131300000000003"
  //...
}
```

## Mising Coordination

How do we inform frontend when regenerating tokens?

How do we provide the frontend with latest terms?

Define currently required claims for frontend, like terms-not-accepted etc.
