Questions:

* JWT bearer token - check with Martin that we should just pass EO JWT to PO Wallet
* DSS Sync State issue
* Wallet(section) creation - when does that occur?
* How do we get the proto-files from PO Wallet?
* Ensure only one cert per measurement (link to zenhub issue)
* How do we handle "bring your own wallet"-scenario? Do we ignore it for now? Is there something like a "default" wallet for Energinet, which is automatically used
