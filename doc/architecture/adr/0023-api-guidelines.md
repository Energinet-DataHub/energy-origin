* Technical Story: API Guidelines

---

## Context and Problem Statement

We are building microservices that will be exposed as a single API and therefore should appear to be a single API.
We need consistency in naming of resources, the usage of verbs and the general structure of the API.

---

## Considered Options  <!-- optional -->

* Custom API Guidelines
* Guidelines by major companies

---

## Decision Outcome

Custom API Guidelines - We will use the defined guideline in Confluence

## Rationale


### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->
We do not have to discuss REST
We want to be more open to API design so that we can better for our context
We do not want to be too strict about adhering to doctrine like for instance CRUD
We do not have to read and understand a very complex guideline

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
We need to have specifications on everything we want to include in our API
There is a higher degree of risk that we missed something that we should have specified
