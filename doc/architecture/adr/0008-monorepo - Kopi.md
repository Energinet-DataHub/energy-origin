* Date: 2022-09-02

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to be able to render Markdown as HTML

---

## Considered Options

* https://github.com/RickStrahl/Westwind.AspNetCore.Markdown

## Decision Outcome

https://github.com/xoofx/markdig

## Rationale

This seems to be the repo with most stars. Event though it is still in version 0.x.x and under construction it seems to be the repo other markdown parsers are using.
It is also quite simple to use
