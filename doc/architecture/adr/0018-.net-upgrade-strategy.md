## Context and Problem Statement

.NET is released yearly in November alternating between releases under Standard Term Support (STS) and Long Term Support (LTS). At the time of writing there is at least two .NET releases with support at any given time with time to switch releases. See https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core for more details.

## Considered Options

* All .NET projects must be upgraded to latest .NET (LTS or STS) release at the same time
* All .NET projects must be on the latest LTS release
* All .NET projects **must** be on a .NET release that is supported. Responsible team for a domain **may** upgrade to latest .NET release for a single domain when the team decides to do so.

---

## Decision Outcome

We chose the option where teams may decide on their own accord to upgrade to the latest .NET release for a domain. Please note that when upgrading a domain, that all .NET projects within that domain should be upgraded at the same time.

## Rationale

The domains are different and the services within a domain have expected lifetime and degree of planned features. We want to be in a situation where the decision about upgrading solely depends on that single domain and not other domains.

This strategy sets the requirement that all .NET projects is based on a supported .NET release. It is up to the responsible team to ensure that .NET projects are running on at least a supported version.

**Note**: In this context we see Eloverblik as a single domain. Upgrading Eloverblik backend would require upgrading all services within Eloverblik at the same time.

### Positive Consequences

* Upgrading to latest .NET can be executed one domain at a time
* Time to unlock latest features in a .NET release is reduced

### Negative Consequences

* There will be differences between .NET version used between domains
