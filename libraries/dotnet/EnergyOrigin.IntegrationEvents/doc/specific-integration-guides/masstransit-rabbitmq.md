# Integration with RabbitMQ using MassTransit's Transactional Outbox Pattern

## Overview

Energy Track & Traceâ„¢ currently uses RabbitMQ, as the message broker for publishing and consuming integration events.
To ensure reliability and consistency between database operations and message publishing,
[MassTransit's](https://masstransit.io/) transactional outbox pattern is used,
using the MassTransit.EntityFrameworkCore, and MassTransit.RabbitMQ NuGet packages.

### Setup Guide

To start publishing integration event messages,
using [Transactional Outbox Configuration](https://masstransit.io/documentation/configuration/middleware/outbox),
then follow these steps:

**1. Install the following NuGet packages:**

```shell
dotnet add package EnergyOrigin.IntegrationEvents
dotnet add package MassTransit.RabbitMQ
dotnet add package MassTransit.EntityFrameworkCore
```

**2. Add the following Configuration to your `appsettings.Development.json` file:**

```
"RabbitMq:Host": "localhost",
"RabbitMq:Port": "5672",
"RabbitMq:Username": "guest",
"RabbitMq:Password": "guest",
```

***Note:** The values here are for demonstration purposes only. RabbitMq values for production use,
should **NEVER** be committed to the repository. Use the deployment manifests,
in our IAC repository to specify the rabbitmq settings that should be used in production.
If you need help with this, ask a Coworker.

**3. Create a `RabbitMqOptions.cs` file:**

```csharp
public class RabbitMqOptions
{
    public const string RabbitMq = "RabbitMq";

    public string Password { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public string Username { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public string Host { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public int? Port { get; set; }
}
```

**4. Load the RabbitMqOptions and enable Masstransit Transactional Outbox,
by following the guide [here](https://masstransit.io/documentation/configuration/middleware/outbox):**

### Testing the integration

Refer to the [following documentation from MassTransit](https://masstransit.io/documentation/concepts/testing),
in order to test out your implementation:

***Note:** You may also refer to the [EnergyOrigin repository](https://github.com/Energinet-DataHub/energy-origin),
for inspiration on how to implement, and test the Transactional Outbox Pattern.
